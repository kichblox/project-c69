  			<p class="text-muted text-left" > Bookshop is an online bookstore with a mission to financially support local, independent bookstores.
We believe that bookstores are essential to a healthy culture. They’re where authors can connect with readers, where we discover new writers, where children get hooked on the thrill of reading that can last a lifetime. They’re also anchors for our downtowns and communities. </p>

		  <p>It doesn't rely solely on its previous installments to wow you. There are new characters, new dangers, and new twists to keep you guessing. It's a satisfying conclusion to a much-loved series. I would definitely refer this to a teen(13-18), an adult (18-infinity) or tween (10-12) year old. The book might have some mildly violent parts like the spells and magic but its all mild, and there is some scenes which a little kid might consider scary, but in reality, its not that bad. Overall great book, 5 out of 5 would recommend.</p>

		  <p> Its a start to a well loved series that set the action in motion and plot in motion for Sea of Monsters, and has epic battles with supernatural beings like Greek Gods, betrayal, and lots and lots of adventure and plot twists. I would definitely refer this to a teen(13-18) or tween (10-12) year old. The book might have some very, very mildly violent parts like the fights between greek gods and capture the flag with swords and things like that but its all mild, and there is some scenes which a little kid might consider scary, but in reality, its not that bad for anyone who is above the age of 3. Overall great book, 5 out of 5 would recommend.</p>
